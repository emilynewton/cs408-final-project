        <h1>Fermat's Little Theorem</h1>
        <p>This theorem plays a big part in the field of number theory, which is a field 
            I would like to discuss more on this page. It deals with modular arithmetic. 
            In order to understand this theorem, it's important to understand the basis 
            of modular arithmetic. Funny enough, many of these concepts have appeared in 
            my computer science classes. It's the first time I have encountered and worked 
            with modular arithmetic. When learning about long division in the early days, 
            you deal with a remainder, but you don't really consider it. When dividing two 
            integers, we're able to represent this as $\frac{A}{B}=Q \text{remainder} R$. $A$ being the 
            dividend, $B$ being the divisor, $Q$ being the quotient, and $R$ representing the remainder.
            Another way that this can be represented is through the modulo operator. 'Modulo' is just some 
            jargon brought in by mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (Ever heard of Gaussian Elimination of 
            linear functions?) This is written as $A \mod B=R$. In words, it's $A modulo B is equal to R$, where $B$ is the modulus. 
            What does this all mean though? If we were to have the problem $12 \mod 5$ for example, the answer 
            would be the remainder of 12 divided by 5, which is 2. So instead of focusing on 
            the amount of times our modulus goes into our dividend, we care only about the remainder, which is unusal.</p>
            <p>So, what exactly is the point of a remainder. I had to ask myself that when I first learned about this. 
            It actually helps to learn about it through programming. In programming, the 'mod'
            is represented using the '%' operator. In the times I have used it, it has been for determining 
            if a number is even or odd. $x % 2$ returns either a 0 or a 1, which means the dividend, $x$, is even or odd, respectively.
            </p> 
            <p> Now, onto the actual theorem is as follows, 
                <br>If $a$ is an integer, $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
            </p>
