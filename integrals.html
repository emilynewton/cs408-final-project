        <div class="topicPage">
          <p>I'm a calculus tutor at Boise State, and integrals are probably one of my favorite things 
            to help with. I just love how it's such a large stepping stone for calculus. You start with the 
            derivative, which I would like to make another page for in the future, which defines the instantaneous 
            rate of change at a single point on a line. Then, you find the area of that line with the integral. 
            But it's interesting because they build off of each other and yet are inverses of each other. I hate 
            calling it an antiderivative though. You're also able to find the area under a curve with Riemann sums, 
            and I LOVE Riemann Sums, my other favorite thing to help with when tutoring... noticing a pattern here. 
            However, they aren't as accurate as integrals, it's more of an approximation, or an educated guess, you 
            could say.  
          </p>
          <p>
            An interesting topic on this concept is integrability of functions. How to know if a function is integrable. 
            Well its easy, if the function is contiuous on a given interval, there you go. But also, if there is only a 
            finite number of discontinuities on an interval.. what? Well, here's the cool thing. Functions with sharp turns 
            such as absolute value functions aren't differentiable, but they are integrable! $y=|x|$ is integrable for all 
            values of $x$, but you can't take the derivative of that. So, I guess it's not TOTALLY an inverse of 
            derivatives, because the set of differentiable functions is a subset of integrable functions.
