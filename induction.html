        <h2>Proof by Induction</h2>
        <div class="topicPage">
            <p> This must be one of my favorite kinds of proofs. When you have a mathetical expression that contains an arbitrary integer of some sort, in most instances it is <em>n</em>, the expression holds true if the condition fits for all <em>n + 1</em>. 
            <br> However, before even starting the induction step on your arbitrary integer, you must prove that the base case holds. This is so very important because it gives you a foundation to lay on. Without it, your proof has nothing. How are you to prove that <em>n + 1</em> is true if you aren't sure <em>n</em> is true? I particularly like induction proofs because of these base cases, they are something so integral to nearly any algorithm that you find in computer science.</p>
