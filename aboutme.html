        <h1>About the author!</h1>
        <p> I'm Emily Newton! I'm a Junior at Boise State University in Idaho currently studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics. So far, I've taken a variety of math courses so far, such as many varities of calculus, some statistics, and some proofs. I'm taking Linear Algebra soon, and perhaps a Topology course in the Spring, which would be amazing! 
            <br> I haven't always appreciated the beauty in math. If I had known sooner, I would probably be a Mathematics major. However, my love for it was always kind of there. It's always been a bit of a hobby for it, even if I felt sort of nerdy. Ever since middle school, I had fun doing problems in my spare time, and I always felt the need to get ahead (Even if that means skipping factoring and having to teach myself). 
            <br> It's sad that many people don't like math, most often because it doesn't make sense which is completely understandable. I believe it all depends on how you are taught. My dream is to be a Calculus professor at a university. 
            <br> Outside of math, I love a variety of things. I've played music for a lot of my life. I love the clarinet and have recently learned the baritone. I enjoy reading and hanging out with my friends. I watch a lot of movies too!
